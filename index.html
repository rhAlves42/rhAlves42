          <h2>About me</h2>
        </header>
        <p>
          Hello, my name is Ricardo Henrique and I’m a solution developer working as a programmer for about five years,
          in this period I had the opportunity to work on frontend/backend/mobile projects. Also, I could improve my
          interpersonal relationship during my career to accomplish better teamwork. I’ve acquired new abilities to
          reach out to the team and deal with challenging situations. My long-time objective is to be a tech leader; for
          that reason, I always try to be available to my team to answer questions and find a solution together, that
          helps increase my teammate's trust and knowledge.
