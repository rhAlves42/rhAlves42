# Hey, I’m Ricardo 👋🧠

> *“Try one more time.”* — Raul Seixas (and every failed build right before it passes)

Welcome to my GitHub.
This is where code meets curiosity, tests keep me honest, and commits tell a story.
I’m a developer who likes things clean, scalable, and meaningful — kind of like a good album, a solid sci‑fi arc, or a well-balanced RPG build.

## 🧠 My Skill Tree (MMO-style)

🗡️ **Frontend Warrior**
React.js, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind
Pixel‑perfect UIs forged straight from Figma — no dark magic, just discipline.

🛡️ **Backend Ally**
Node.js, NestJS, Django, FastAPI, GraphQL
I speak backend well enough to avoid “it works on my machine” wars.

🧪 **Testing Paladin**
Jest, RTL, Cypress, Vitest, Playwright
If it’s not tested, it’s just a rumor.

⚙️ **Architecture & DX Monk**
Reusable hooks, scalable patterns, clean boundaries.
I refactor like Kratos fights gods — calmly, but decisively.

## 🚀 Projects & Quests Completed

🩺 **Healthcare App (HIPAA Mode: ON)**
React Native + Next.js apps where data protection is sacred.
No shortcuts. No sonic screwdrivers.

💳 **Fintech Platform**
Real‑time data, performance tuning, and UX improvements.
Think *1984*, but fighting for transparency instead.

🛒 **E‑commerce Platform**
Checkout flows, Stripe & PayPal integrations, and UI optimization.
Statistics never lied — they were just misused.

Every project here started as chaos.
Then tests were written.
Then order emerged.
Very *Doctor Who*.
