          <p>
            I'm a solution developer and I have worked with software development for about 3 years. Working in web
            projects, acting in roles like UI and front-end. Besides that, I've had some adventures working on the
            back-end. With each challenge that emerged I've learned something new, that can be used to improve my
            performance on my job. I have some abilities like fast learning, resilience and good interpersonal
            relationships. I'm committed to my dreams, and work every minute to reach them.

              On this company I was able to be part on multiples projects working either as a front and back-end
              developer.
              Using technologies like <span class="b">React (Js&Native), Gatsby, GraphQL, Nest, Node,
                Typescript</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acting on tasks like improving UI and UX in a checkout flow for a big telecom
              company.

              Help to develop a web portifolio for a real state company where the challenge was to bring the
              elegance and finesse of those buildings to the project.

              Being part of a social network app that allows
              their users to share thier valueable knowledge with the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              On all those project I've work on <span class="b">Scrum</span> based projects and using the default
              development flow like:
              Understand the task -> Write the code -> QA team -> Code review -> Merge.
              That help me improve my workflow and the way that I undestand and see the requirements and how to apply on
              the code;
