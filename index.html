          <p>
            I'm a solution developer and I have worked with software development for about 3 years. Working in web
            projects, acting in roles like UI and front-end. Besides that, I've had some adventures working on the
            back-end. With each challenge that emerged I've learned something new that can be used to improve my
            performance on my job. I have some abilities like fast learning, resilience and good interpersonal
            relationships. I'm committed to my dreams, and work every minute to reach them.
